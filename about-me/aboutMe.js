    Need commitment to working on insecurities, especially the need for constant validation
        EMDR?
        Telling me you love me only to hear it back
        Ok to ask for some positive reinforcment every now and then
    Snooping for private journals/chats/etc. is NOT OKAY
        Everyone deserves to have some privacy
    Passive aggressiveness
        I can do this too, but it needs to be worked on and acknowledged soon after, with progress shown
    Communicate what is wrong, rather than just giving looks
        If you are going to be non-verbal, don't put anything on anyone else until you can communicate it
        Ask yourself, "have I communicated what I'm upset about clearly?"
        I need to work on this too. Communicating things are not my strong suit
    Prompting to expect a certain type of reply, and getting upset when you don't get exactly what you wanted
        Not going to engage with assumed blame or unspoken issues coming up passive aggressively
    Going to need some space to handle the boys disciplining
        I know I can have a relaxed style, but I don't need an extra layer of anxiety on top of handling them
        I don't mind reminders, but having energy for them can run out by the end of the day, so being pushed and judged to be more on top of things is tough
        I appreciate your ability to hold off that last time, but I still got the "look" from you
